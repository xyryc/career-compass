   users can see their information like- name, email, and photoURL and there will be a form with

   This "saving" process uses Firebase's [updateProfile()](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/web/manage-users?hl=en&authuser=0)
   method to update the user's information stored securely in Firebase. ✅
